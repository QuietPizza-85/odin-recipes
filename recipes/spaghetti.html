        <h4>Recipe description</h4>
        <p>
            I’ve found a few easy tricks to take my most-hated childhood meal into something truly amazing, a dinner that everyone in the family looks forward too, including yours truly. This recipe is SO much better than the mixed-up-in-the-pot version. And yes, we are starting with a jar of marinara from the store.</p>
        
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
                <li>Onion</li>
                <li>Spices</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Marinara sauce</li>
                <li>Crushed or diced tomatoes</li>
                <li>Italian sausage</li>
                <li>Balsamic vinegar</li>
                <li>Beef base</li>
                <li>Spaghetti noodles</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>I like to start out by getting all my chopping out of the way. Chopping stuff is usually the hurdle for me that stands between my idea of an “easy dinner” and a hard one.</li>
                <li>The one that’s harder to fake is an onion. But I can usually handle it as long as I have my trusty goggles. I’ll spare you the photo of them on my face and the raccoon eyes I have for an hour afterward.</li>
                <li>Heat up some olive oil and sauté your onions for a few minutes. Add in the spices now so they have time to get all toasty before adding in the liquid. Sautéing in oil is a great trick to bring out the flavor of dried herbs.</li>
                <li>Add in your garlic for a minute, then your Italian sausage. I like to use mild Italian sausage, which has a little heat to it but not too much. You could also use Sweet Italian sausage, it has nothing spicy but instead sweet basil added to it.</li>
                <li>Break up the sausage and cook fully. At this point you can take a minute to drain if it’s looking really fatty. I usually don’t bother if it’s just a little bit.</li>
                <li>Now it’s time to add in our sauce. I love using Rao’s Marinara, but really any brand will do because we’re doctoring it up so much. We are also adding in a 15-ounce can of crushed tomatoes, or petite diced tomatoes will do if you can’t find that size can.</li>
                <li>Add about a cup of water to your spaghetti sauce jar to clean it out, then add it to the sauce. Add in a bit of balsamic vinegar and some Beef Base to amp up that beefy flavor</li>
                <li>Once you have all the ingredients in, it’s up to you how long you want to simmer. 10 minutes is fine, 20 minutes it better, an hour is best but I rarely do this. The longer you simmer, the more flavorful it will be. If you are simmering a long time, be sure to add a bit more water every half hour or so, to keep it from getting too thick.</li>
            </ol>
